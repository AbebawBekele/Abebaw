    Ethics is a branch of philosophy that attempts to understand people’s moral beliefs and actions (these modules use the
    terms, ‘ethics’ and ‘morality’; ‘ethical’ and ‘moral’ interchangeably, although traditionally ‘ethics’ described the
    process of thinking about people’s morality). Ethics, or moral philosophy, considers theories about what human beings
    are capable of doing, alongside accounts of what they ought to do if they are to live an ethically good life. Ethics
    also explores the meaning and the ranking of different ethical values, such as honesty, autonomy, equality and justice,
    and it considers ethical quandaries that human beings face in the course of living their own independent but, also,
    socially interdependent lives.
    Ethics, or moral philosophy: considers theories about what human beings are capable of doing, alongside accounts of what
    they ought to do if they are to live an ethically good life. Ethics may share common ground with the law, religious
    belief, popular opinion, professional codes and the dictates of authority figures, but it is also broader than all of
    these and offers a set of tools and values against which their appropriateness can be evaluated.
    Invariably all ethical questions involve a decision about what one should do in a specific instance. Notice the word
    should. Ethical questions are not concerned with what one would do (an essentially psychological concern) but what one
    ought to do. Judgments about such decisions are generally expressed with words like right and wrong, should and ought,
    or obligation and duty.
    Occasionally the term ethics is used interchangeably with morals. Business or medical ethics, for example, is generally
    synonymous with morals. Although this is acceptable, a precise usage would apply the term’s morals and moral to the
    conduct itself, while the terms ethics and ethical would refer to the study of moral conduct or to the code that one
    follows. Thus, the specific act of telling the caller you were home could be described as moral or immoral. But what
    makes any act moral or immoral, right or wrong fall within the province of ethics.</p>
