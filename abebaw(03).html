<h2>this is my interesting subject that i am taking in eiabc</h2>

<p>Anthropology is the study of people—their origins, their development, and contemporary variations, wherever and whenever
they have been found. It is a broad scientific discipline dedicated to the comparative study of humans as a group, from
its first appearance on earth to its present stage of development. Of all the disciplines that study humans,
anthropology is by far the broadest in scope.
In more specific terms, anthropology is the science which:
 investigates the strategies for living that are learned and shared by people as members of human social groups;
 examines the characteristics that human beings share as members of one species (homo sapiens) and the diverse ways
that people live in different environments;
 analyses the products of social groups: material objects (material cultures) and non-material creations
(religion/beliefs, social values, institutions, practices, etc.).
Anthropology is an intellectually challenging, theoretically ambitious subject, which tries to achieve an understanding
of culture, society and humanity through detailed studies of community life, supplemented by comparison. At the deepest
level, it raises philosophical questions, which it tries to respond to by exploring human lives under different
conditions. Anthropology seeks to explain how and why people are both similar and different through examination of our
biological and cultural past and comparative study of contemporary human societies. The ultimate goal of anthropology is
to develop an integrated picture of humankind—a goal that encompasses an almost infinite number of questions about all
aspects of our existence. We ask, for example, what makes us human? Why do some groups of people tend to be tall and
lanky, while others tend to be short and stocky? Why do some groups of people practice agriculture, while others hunt
for a living?</p>
